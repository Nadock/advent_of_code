# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a is an advent calendar of small programming puzzles. A new calendar of
puzzles is released day-by-day every December.

This repo contains my solution code for each puzzle and the my unique inputs for that puzzle. Each puzzle typically has
two parts, the first part usually being easier and the second an extension of the first.

My account on the [AoC](https://adventofcode.com) website is linked to this GitHub account.

This code is all MIT licensed, so if you would like to borrow from it you are welcome to. However, the code is not
production quality in any way so don't expect anything particularly performant, clean, beautify, etc.

## 2022

The solutions for 2022 are written in Python, and generally I'm taking a more relaxed approach to this year's calendar.

## 2021

2021 was the first year I participated and I was using it as practice for writing Golang, which I hadn't done in a long
time.
